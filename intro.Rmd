### Instructor

- WELCOME IN THIS HUPO COURSE ON EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AND DATA ANALYSIS
- MY NAME IS LIEVEN CLEMENT
- I AM A PROFESSOR STATISTICAL GENOMICS AT GHENT UNIVERSITY BELGIUM


  1. Sources of variability in label-free proteomics experiments
  2. Experimental design concepts for proteomics data analysis
  3. Tutorial on msqrob2 with the GUI
  

Many software tools exist for differential proteomics data analysis, e.g. 

- MaxQuant - Perseus
- MSstats
- DEqMS
- msqrob2

Here, we will illustrate all concepts using the msqrob2 software. 

- POWERFUL R SCRIPTING SOFTWARE
- GUI
